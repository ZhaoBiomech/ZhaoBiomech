- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZhaoBiomech
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of biomechanics and data science to improve athletic performance, reduce injury risk, and inform product design!
- ðŸ“š Completed a masters of science in Biomechanics where I studied determinants of movement strategy in lifting. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking to improve my coding skills by completing some passion projects, and learn how to use github!
